## Purpose

Package '**ggpextra**' (Grammar Extensions to 'ggplot2') is a set of
extensions to R package 'ggplot2' (>= 3.0.0). New geoms support insets plots,
tables and grobs as insets using a syntax consistent with the grammar of 
graphics. The grammar is also extended to support native plot coordinates 
(npc) so that annotations can be easily positioned using new geometries and
scales. New position functions facilitate the labelling of observations by
nudging labels away or towards curves or a focal virtual centre. New variations
of `"outward"` and `"inward"` justification complement the new types of nudge.

## Extended Grammar of graphics

The position of annotations within the plotting area depends in most cases on
graphic design considerations rather than on properties such as the range of
values in the data being plotted. In particular, the location within the
plotting area of large annotation objects like model-fit summaries, location
maps, plots, and tables needs usually to be set independently of the `x` and `y`
scales, re-scaling or any transformations. To acknowledge this, the Grammar of
Graphics is here expanded by supporting _x_ and _y_ positions expressed in
'grid' "npc" units in the range 0..1. This is implemented with new
(pseudo-)aesthetics _npcx_ and _npcy_ and their corresponding scales, plus
geometries and a revised `annotate()` function. The new aesthetics function in
"parallel" with the _x_ and _y_ aesthetics used for plotting data. The advantage
of this approach is that the syntax used for annotations becomes identical to
that used for plotting data and that these geoms _cleanly_ support 
facets in a way consistent with the rest of the grammar.

## Aesthetics and scales

Scales `scale_npcx_continuous()` and  `scale_npcy_continuous()` and the
corresponding new aesthetics `npcx` and `npcy` make it possible to add graphic
elements and text to plots using coordinates expressed in `npc` units for the
location within the plotting area.

Scales `scale_x_logFC()` and `scale_y_logFC()` are suitable for plotting of log
fold change data. Scales `scale_x_Pvalue()`, `scale_y_Pvalue()`, `scale_x_FDR()`
and `scale_y_FDR()` are suitable for plotting _p_-values and adjusted _p_-values
or false discovery rate (FDR). Default arguments are suitable for volcano and
quadrant plots as used for transcriptomics, metabolomics and similar data. 

Scales `scale_colour_outcome()`, `scale_fill_outcome()` and 
`scale_shape_outcome()` and functions `outome2factor()`, `threshold2factor()`,
`xy_outcomes2factor()` and `xy_thresholds2factor()` used together make it 
easy to map ternary numeric outputs and logical binary outcomes to color,
fill and shape aesthetics. Default arguments are suitable for volcano,
quadrant and other plots as used for genomics, metabolomics and similar data.

## Geometries

Geometries `geom_table()`, `geom_plot()` and `geom_grob()` make it possible to
add inset tables, inset plots, and arbitrary 'grid' graphical objects including
bitmaps and vector graphics as layers to a ggplot using native coordinates for
`x` and `y`.

Geometries `geom_text_npc()`, `geom_label_npc()`, `geom_table_npc()`,
`geom_plot_npc()` and `geom_grob_npc()`, `geom_text_npc()` and
`geom_label_npc()` are versions of geometries that accept positions on _x_
and _y_ axes using aesthetics `npcx` and `npcy` values expressed in "npc" units.

Geometries `geom_x_margin_arrow()`, `geom_y_margin_arrow()`,
`geom_x_margin_grob()`, `geom_y_margin_grob()`, `geom_x_margin_point()` and
`geom_y_margin_point()` make it possible to add marks along the _x_ and _y_
axes. `geom_vhlines()` and `geom_quadrant_lines()` draw vertical and horizontal
reference lines within a single layer.

Geometry `geom_text_linked()` connects text drawn at a nudged position to
the original position, usually that of a point being labelled.

## Statistics

Statistic `stat_fmt_tb()` helps with the formatting of tables to be plotted
with `geom_table()`. 

Four statistics, `stat_dens2d_filter()`, `stat_dens2d_label()`,
`stat_dens1d_filter()` and `stat_dens1d_label()`, implement tagging or selective
labelling of observations based on the local 2D density of observations in a
panel. Another two statistics, `stat_dens1d_filter_g()` and
`stat_dens1d_filter_g()` compute the density by group instead of by plot panel.
These six stats are designed to work well together with `geom_text_repel()` and
`geom_label_repel()` from package 'ggrepel'.

The statistics `stat_apply_panel()` and `stat_apply_group()` can be useful for
applying arbitrary functions returning numeric vectors. They are specially
useful with functions lime `cumsum()`, `cummax()` and `diff()`.

## Position functions

New position functions implementing different flavours of nudging are provided:
`position_nudge_keep()`, `position_nudge_to()`, `position_nudge_center()` and
`position_nudge_line()`. These last two functions make it possible to apply
nudging that varies automatically according to the relative position of points
with respect to arbitrary points or lines, or with respect to a polynomial or
smoothing spline fitted on-the-fly to the the observations. In contrast to
`ggplot2::position_nudge()` all these functions return the repositioned and
original _x_ and _y_ coordinates.

## History

This package is a "spin-off" from package 'ggpmisc' containing extensions to the
grammar originally written for use wihtin 'ggpmisc' but which are of general
usefulness. As 'ggpmisc' has grown in size, spliting it into two packages seems
the best option. Package 'ggpmisc' will remain as a "loader" of the packages
into which it is being split.

## Examples

```{r readme-02, message=FALSE}
library(ggpextra)
library(ggrepel)
```


A plot with an inset plot.

```{r, readme-06}
p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(factor(cyl), mpg, colour = factor(cyl))) +
  stat_boxplot() +
  labs(y = NULL) +
  theme_bw(9) + theme(legend.position = "none")

ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg, colour = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point() +
  annotate("plot_npc", npcx = "left", npcy = "bottom", label = p) +
  expand_limits(y = 0, x = 0)
```
